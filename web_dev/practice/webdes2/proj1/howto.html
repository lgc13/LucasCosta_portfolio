  <p>Do you think of the Beatles when you hear the word Rock? Or  do you imagine a huge stadium full of <img src="images/drums.jpg" alt="drums" width="300" height="300" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right" />long haired people, head banging their  heads back and forth to the furious rhythms of metal rock? If you have thought  about anything in between these two, you might just realize how spread apart  Rock’s subgenres are from each other. Let’s take a look on some famous ones:</p>
  <h3><br />
    -Alternate Metal: started around the 70’s, and was made up  of upbeat songs, with some well generates solos. It has a bit of a “punk” to  it, which makes the rhythm sound a whole lot more like our regular pop and sometimes  even hip-hop.</h3>
  <h3><br />
    -Hard Rock: more of a ballad in a sonically aggressive way  often with powerful chorus highlighted by electric guitars. If you need  something to pump you up in the gym, hard rock has gotten it.</h3>
  <h3><br />
    -Post-Grunge: this is your Nirvana, and Pearl Jam. More  heavy and dark than most rock themes. Vocalists tend to put more private  thoughts into the lyrics which makes it all a whole lot more deep and  sentimental.</h3>
