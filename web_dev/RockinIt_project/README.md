# Rockin' It project
<!-- Project BIO -->
This is a static web site which displays some information about Rock n' Roll! By opening this web site, a user can see information about Rock's history, some statics of its genres, an imbedded Youtube video, and some other references. This is one of the first projects that I made using HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap.

This application displays some of my skills with:

- Bootstrap
- Imbedding videos onto HTML
- Div classes and Grid system
- Basic JavaScript concepts
- HTML and CSS

"BRIEF TALK ABOUT THE FOLLOWING CODE SNIPPET:"

<!-- Code snippet -->
For this web site, I use a simple nav bar id from Bootstrap. This makes it very easy to have a well aligned, colorful, and adjustable nav bar. I also use href links for each nav bar list option, so that when clicked, the page will scroll down to find that specific area.

```html

<!--Navigation Bar holds Navigation Buttons -->
<div id="navbar">
	<div class="container">  <!-- container keeps everything aligned and centered no matter what the window size -->
		<ul id="menu">
			<!-- button class provides button-like appearance and scrolling javascript (see bottom of html code) -->
			<li><a href="#overview" class="button">Overview</a></li>
			<li><a href="#video" class="button">Video</a></li>
   		<li><a href="#discography" class="button">Discography</a></li>
		</ul>
	</div> <!-- end container -->
</div> <!-- end navbar -->

```
