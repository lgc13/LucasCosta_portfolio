I learned how the basic concepts of Web Development during high school and college, where I created some simple static web pages with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Soon after that, I picked up concepts on make dynamic web pages which utilized PHP or JSP files, running through HTTP servers such as Apache and Tomcat. I created some dynamic projects which display my use of these skills along with Databases such as MySQL and Oracle.
